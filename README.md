Sustainable Urban Mobility Simulator

This project is a simulation of a sustainable urban mobility system in a city environment. It models the interaction between shared vehicles (bikes, e-scooters, and motorbikes), docking stations, users, and maintenance workers, all within a digital and controllable environment.

Key Features

Users require vehicles in good condition with enough battery to travel.

Maintenance workers are responsible for recharging and repairing vehicles.

Funding for maintenance is provided through user fees.

Each entity has specific behaviors and goals. By executing the simulation, it's possible to observe how the system adapts to different conditions, helping identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and potential improvements in service design.

Technical Details

The software is written entirely in Java and uses object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a modular and extensible architecture. Each class corresponds to a real-world concept (e.g., User, Vehicle, Station, Worker) and encapsulates both its state and behavior.

Purpose

This project provides an abstract yet realistic representation of urban mobility dynamics and is useful for exploring how such systems function under different scenarios.
